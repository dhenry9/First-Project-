<h1> Rio Grande Southern Railroad</h1>
<p> The Rio Grande Southern Railroad operated from 1891 through 1951 between Durango and Ridegeway. It was built to trasport the silver coming from the mines in the towns of Rico and Telluride. The railroad was very succesful in the first few years of its existence, but due to the Silver Panic of 1893, the railroads finances were crippled, and it operated in backruptcy for the rest of its life.</p>

<p> Above is RGS 20, built in 1899. This locomotive was restored over the course of 12 years and returned to operation in 2020. This locomotive has the distinction of being used in the 1950 film, "A Ticket to Tomahawk" </p>
<p> The Rio Grande Southern constucted 7 railcars between 1913-1936, known as "Galloping Geese". These engines were used to transport small ammounts of passengers, frieght, and mail between Durango and Ridgeway. They were essentialy a hybrid between a car and a bus riding on railroad track. They were devised when the railroad was financially struggling as the steam locomotives were becoming too expensive to operate. Out of all the Geese, 6 out of 7 originals survive with a replica of the scrapped 1st Goose. One Goose is used at Knotts Berry Farm in Buena Park, California.
