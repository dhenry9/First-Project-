<h1> Colorado and Southern Railroad </h1>

<p> The Colorado and Southern railroad was formed in 1898. It started as the combination of the Colorado Central Railroad and Cheyenne and Northern which formed the Union Pacific, Denver and Gulf Railway in 1890. The Union Pacifc went bankrupt in 1893, and the 3 railroads were brought togther with the Denver, Leadville and Gunnison Railway, forming the Colorado and Southern. Later, in 1981, it merged into the Burlington Northern Railroad, which merged with the Santa Fe, forming the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (BNSF), which still exists today. <br>
