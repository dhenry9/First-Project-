<h1> Denver and Rio Grande Railroad </h1>
<p> The Denver and Rio Gradne Railroad or D&RGW was formed in 1870 as a narrow gauge line to run between Denver, Colorado and Salt Lake City, Utah. It was mainly used for coal and mineral transporation. The D&RGW also owned standard gauge lines which existed even up until 1992, when it was merged into the Southern Pacific Railroad. A few sections of the D&RGW narrow gauge lines exist today, like the Durango and Silverton Railroad and the Cumbres and Toltec Railroad.
